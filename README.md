Thats it!


--------
Due to lack of time for this chalenge and the need for the evaluatory to get this up and running easily no database was used. 
Local storage was used in place of a database to demonstrate functionality. 
If this were an actual application authenication would have been integrated in a way to use JWT tokens and send those tokens with every reuest.
